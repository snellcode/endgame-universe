# Chapter 1 — The Birth of Zero

The Human world had long known of the vast spaces beyond the ring of Antarctica. Over hundreds of generations little changed. The garbage just gets pushed further and further out. Huge vehicles move it into mounds, and over time form the Great Garbage Mountains. 

Over the long years, a new form of life found itself a home within the waste. Similar in form to Human, but born not of Earth. Born of the Cosmic Expanse beyond the last Human sewer pipes and vehicles. Born with pulsing blue veins behind their ears. Resistant to cold, bitter, but stoic, these people are the Antarca, the Cold Ones, the Garbage Monsters. Tales of them were told among Humans. Antarcans had their myths as well.

For the Antarcan, there was no greater dream than to break into Earth. To live near the warm beaches instead of the cold garbage. They hated the Humans, and hoped to replace them on Earth some day. The desperate and nomadic often made the attempt. None returned, but the remaining held out hope that some made it to Earth.

The Humans showed no mercy to the Antarcans. The veins behind the ears always give them away. Human guards are ordered to terminate on site. Attempts to talk had long been abandoned. Humans saw Antarcans as the evil result of the cold garbage world they come from.

On a day like any other, with the massive sewer pipes belching out their filth, the distant clanking and rumbling of machinery, an Antarcan child was born. They named him Zero since he was so cold, a good omen among Antarcans. This means the child is healthy and very resistant to cold. The pulsing blue veins behind the ears mark him for life as Antarcan, loathed and feared by the Humans.

Down underground in a makeshift Geothermal Farm, Zero grows up as well as any of his kind can hope for. Not living as a nomad like many, but with roots, a family and a home. It is with farm communities like this the Antarcans hope to shape a new destiny farther away from the Humans. Far out into the deep cold plains of the Cosmic Expanse, where no trace of Humans or their filth can be found. This is one destiny for Antarcans, but it will not be the one chosen for Zero.

# Chapter 2 — A Chance Meeting

Sami was a six year old Antarcan girl who loved to collect rocks for her mother. Her mother would paint them, and then Sami would place the painted ones by her bed. Every night when she slept, Sami would drift off looking at those rocks.

One night she had a dream about finding a perfectly round rock, a sphere! Her mother was so proud! The next day Sami was up early above the farm collecting rocks. She knew the rule was to stay down in the farm. She also knew something that the grown ups did not understand. Sami knew that the best rocks were actually higher up.

So up she went, and picked up rock after rock, though she only wanted to bring back one. The round one, the sphere, the one from her dreams… Or at least a more round one… But every time she picked one, she would see just a little further off, a rounder rock.

Throwing aside the current rock, she rushed over and picked up the new rock. This went on for a while as she moved up through the gnarled trees of the tiny scrub forest by the river. Up out onto the edge of the Cosmic Expanse.

Sharp rocks covered in ice and snow jutted out nearby. Far in the distance the great Garbage Mountains encircled her. The little river that lead down to the farm was becoming ever farther away. But so consumed was Sami with her mission, she didn’t notice she had stumbled right into a two man Human Scout Team.

The team consisted of a Sniper and Spotter. They had been scouting the small forest and river, but had found nothing. They were resting and preparing to return to base. Their mission is to find a potential hive in the warmer low lands. Once they find a hive, they are ordered to call in the Rapid Air Assault Team. They have to work quickly, because Antarcans are always on high alert for a Human raid.

If Antarcans know they are discovered, the farm will be immediately evacuated. They will take only what they need, and scatter away across the Cosmic Expanse. They have many back doors and contingency plans, and will attempt to re-group and form a new hive further out. The Human Assaults attempt to take out as many Antarcans as possible, or at least cause them to panic and lose contact with their hive mates. Such Antarcans are doomed to live as Nomads, always on the run and easier to kill.

The Sniper was clumsily but persistently cleaning his gun with ice cold hands. His light inner gloves did very little to keep him warm. He was almost done cleaning his rifle when he looked up right into the eyes of the Antarcan girl. Startled by this little bug in tattered blue and grey flannel, the parts of his rifle clattered to the ground. In that moment, Sami panicked and covered her little ears. She knew that if they saw behind her ears, they would know she was not Human. She then felt a quick sharp prick in her left leg.

Realizing she had just given herself away with her movements, Sami quickly turned and ran back towards home. The Sniper had by now lifted his sidearm to shoot, but the Spotter hit his hand away, sending the shot wide. “Call it in” said the Spotter, holding up his tracker display. The green blip was strong and moving. The Sniper nodded, and called in the location to the Rapid Air Assault Team. “That little bug will lead us all the way home to mama!” said the Sniper, laughing.

# Chapter 3 — The Birth of Minus

When Zero was born, many were impressed with him. His coldness to the touch, slow shallow breathing, strong pulsing blue behind the ears. They celebrated and cheered to his health. But two years later when his sister was born, it was to total shock and amazement. She was as cold as ice, and even her skin had a blue glow to it, instead of the common Antarcan grey hues of her parents.

She seemed to glow with a coldness yet unheard of among their kind. Her oversized head and eyes were fed by a large web of pulsing blue light from behind her ears. She was a sight to see. They knew at that moment, she was neither Human nor Antarcan. She was something entirely new. A being so cold, and so much colder than Zero, so they named her Minus.

Minus was never the social or athletic type, but she excelled at math. She was most often completely still and silent. She would sit at the edge of the farm, just outside the entrance, staring up the river. Hidden in a little nook of the scrub forest, sitting on a rock, she would watch. Parents and teachers would try to stop her, but she would always return. Waiting and watching for hours at a time. As if just waiting for a Human Assault, so she could be one extra step ahead.

She always knew the answers in school, but never did her homework. The teachers could clearly see Minus was a genius, and asked her “Minus, why don’t you do your homework?”. She said “I’m doing my homework just fine.”, and so they passed her as a C student. So day after day, year after year, she kept her vigil. Although at this moment she was strangely absent from her post.

Perhaps Minus had a foreboding sense of danger on the way. She was in her room packing her bags as Sami was running down the river bank and into the maze of scrub forest that hid the entrance to the farm.

# Chapter 4 — Evacuation

As Minus was packing her bags, Zero was just headed topside for a smoke. He had a particularly fragrant variety of Kush that his Engineer friend Wedge grows. Zero loves going topside for his smoke breaks, and looking out on their little scrub forest and the garbage hills far beyond. Then joining Minus for a few minutes in silence, he often imagines life out there on the Cosmic Expanse as a Nomad. One that can never return home. Nomads live a life of total war, surviving day to day until run down by Humans. Some even try to climb up the huge sewer pipes and break into Earth.

Antarcans have a rule that when you turn 20, you get your own Beacon. A Beacon is a rod you hold in two hands, and in the center forms a light. The color, shape, and direction of the light lead Antarcans together at great distances. However, if an Antarcan is tracked, trapped, or otherwise captured, the first thing they are told to do is break their Beacon. The Beacon has sturdy handles, but a fragile center. When one is trapped, they hold the Beacon in two hands, and break it in half. To the terror of nearby Humans, they often shout “Nomad Forever!” and rush headlong into battle against the Humans. By doing so, they give the other Antarcans a better chance to escape and rebuild.

As Sami scrambled along the river bank, and down through the scrub forest, she finally charged right into Zero. Nearly knocking him to the ground, and sending his joint flying, she yelled over and over “Humans! Humans!”. Instinct kicked in, and Zero knew what he needed to do. First he had to hit the Main Alarm, Wedge in Engineering can help with that. Then to his room to grab his Beacon, and then scatter with Sami as fast as possible. “Stay right here! … but hide! … I’ll be back!” stammered Zero, as he opened the rusty iron hatch, and sped off down to the Engineering Lab. Sami hid a few feet away behind a bolder, and tried to make herself as small as possible. As she looked down to her feet, she saw right there in front of her a small but quite round rock.

It wasn’t as big as the one in her dreams, but she happily grabbed it up to give to Mom later. Sami patiently waited there for Zero to return.

# Chapter 5 — Go Time

Zero wondered if Sami would be OK. Should he have brought her down? No, if Humans are on the way, we have no time… she’s already topside… just tell Wedge, grab the Beacon, grab Sami… hit the road on a bike over the Cosmic Expanse… As Zero went he said to himself, “The thing is to be fast, faster than the Humans. That’s how we stay ahead… that’s how we survive…”. As Zero ran into the Engineering Lab, Wedge jumped up from his large office chair and shouted “It Works!”.

The Engineering Lab smelled of diesel and electrical fires in addition to the familiar wet garbage odor. A layer of greasy looking dust covered everything, except where wires had been moved recently. Stacks of ancient and recent tech mixed together with blinking lights, and countless wires connecting them. Zero really felt for Wedge in that moment, knowing he’d have to leave most of his toys behind. Wedge had a fairly recent laptop on his desk that he had finally got to boot up. Just the perfect tech to help start up a new Geothermal Farm further away from the Humans.

Zero ran up and and grabbed Wedge and shook him “Buddy, snap out of it, we got Humans!”. Wedge went from elated to stern immediately. Just like Zero, years of indoctrination kicked in, and he was forming a plan. Zero smiled, he knew that look, Wedge was on the case. “OK Wedge? Hit the alarm! See you topside! I have to go, kid waiting on me!” yelled Zero as he ran out the door, and down the hall to his room.

Beacon, check. Go Bag, check. “Um… what else?” As Zero looked around his room for the last time ever, his eyes fell on the bag of Kush… With that, a little pipe, and a lighter, he was off. Back topside to get Sami, and get the hell out of here quick. “Follow the plan, Follow the plan, smooth, fast…” he chanted as he went, Beacon in hand. Zero crashed his way up through the iron hatch, and looked around for Sami. “Over here!” Shouted Minus, who was nearby, Beacon in hand just like Zero. Sami by her side looking up at her, and holding her other hand.

Minus raised her Beacon, and instinctively so did Zero. They knew, as long as we hold these Beacons, we can reunite. Sometimes it takes days, sometimes years, but the Beacon gives hope to all Antarcans.

# Chapter 6 — Zero the Nomad

An earth shattering boom followed by screeching of metal on metal tore through the air. Wedge had hit the Main Alarm, and opened the Garage. From there vehicles of all shapes sped away, but most took bikes. The only rules: 1. Don’t stop for anything. 2. Never let a Human touch a working Beacon. Just then Wedge came crashing along the river bank in his Jeep. “There you are! hop in!” shouted Wedge. They all hopped quickly into the Jeep, Zero in the front with Wedge, and Minus and Sami in the back seats. Wedge started driving up the river bank towards the Cosmic Expanse.

As they began to move, a shot whizzed by. The Sniper and Spotter had followed Sami, and taken position on a hill near the river covering the escaping vehicles. The Human Scouts hoped to take advantage of the confusion, and kill off a few escaping Antarcans while the Assault Team was on its way. Zero’s heart sank, he knew somebody had to confront the scout team, so that Wedge, Minus, Sami and the rest could make a clean escape. Not to mention the risk of those Human Scouts finding a working Beacon. Zero made his decision, and opened the door of the moving Jeep. Prepared to jump Zero shouted “Go on, I’ll take care of the Scouts!”. Seeing this Wedge Screeched the Jeep to a stop.

“Are you crazy? Get in and close the door!” yelled Wedge, but Minus put her hand on Wedge’s shoulder, and said “No”. A tear was rolling down her cheek as she turned and looked at Zero said “Go my brother, you will know what to do.”. As another shot hit the side of the Jeep, Zero rolled out, and Wedge floored it. Zero ran back along the river bank towards the Garage. As he both hoped and feared, the Sniper was now shooting at him. “Good, come for me…” he said to himself as he ran.

The Sniper laughed. “What the hell is that bug doing? I could swear I hit it twice now, but it’s still moving.”. The Spotter pointed and yelled “The Jeep, quick, they’re getting away!”, but the Sniper was already shooting round after round towards Zero as he was escaping towards the Garage. “Damn! Damn! Damn!” Yelled the Sniper as he gathered up his gear, and Zero moved out of view around a corner. “Not today, this bug is mine” said the Sniper, and he went scrambling down the hill towards the river bank following Zero. The Spotter shook his head, and followed the Sniper.

The Antarcans had many vehicles fueled and ready for just such an event. Zero grabbed a helmet from the rack, hopped on a fast looking bike. He fiddled with the controls until he remembered how to start it. His plan was to drive up the river bank, then drive towards the scout team to distract them. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he took his Beacon in both trembling hands, and broke it, throwing the pieces to the ground. “Nomad Forever” he mumbled quietly to himself. He then realized he still had his Go Bag, and in there, the bag of Kush. “Not all bad, then…” he continued mumbling as the bike gained speed out the Garage and up the river bank.

To his surprise Zero saw that the Scout team was on the move just ahead of him. He smiled a crooked smile, and maxed the throttle towards the team. Zero’s bike plowed right into the Sniper before he could react, cutting him nearly in half, killing him instantly. In the collision Zero lost control and flew off the bike as it spun off, crashed into a tree, blew up, and fell into a burning heap of metal. The Spotter had been spared, and just thrown aside. However, seeing his dead partner on the ground, the Spotter ran away screaming “Nomads? I didn’t sign up for this shit!”.

Zero just sat there for a moment stunned, and then seeing the Spotter running, he rubbed his eyes, got up and ran too, but back to the Garage. “Shit…” he said as he looked down at the broken Beacon on the floor of the garage. The Antarcans had bikes to spare, but not Beacons. Those were rare, and made specifically for each Antarcan as they come of age. If only he’d known he’d get away, he could have kept the Beacon and be on his way to meet up with Wedge, Minus and Sami.

Instead he sped away towards the massive sewer pipes far in the distance towards Earth. He was scared, and his face wet with tears, and often felt the urge to turn around and try to find his people. Each time something stopped him, and he kept on going towards the sewer pipes and the Humans. “No” he said to himself. “Nomads go this way… never the other… I’m a Nomad now.”

Minus also cried her quiet tears, huddled together with Sami as Wedge drove away from the approaching Human Assault Helis. So began their new life as refugees looking for a new home, and Zero’s new life as a Nomad heading towards Earth.
