## Chapter 1: The Beacon Ritual

“It’s time, and we’re safe here, we have to call” said Wedge. Minus checked the time “Yep, better get used to this I guess”. Wedge slowed to a stop on the ice plains of the Cosmic Expanse. Large jagged rocks jutting out here and there covered in ice and snow. The Garbage Mountains behind them now. Wedge remembered the extra Beacons. “Hey Sami, grab a Beacon from the back? You just got promoted!”. Sami had been drifting between crying and sleeping, and had a deep frown on her face as she glared at Wedge. Sami was not impressed with the attempt at humor, but grudgingly agreed.

“I know you miss Mom, but if there’s any chance she’s out there, she will hear us, OK?” said Minus. Sami nodded, smiling again, but her eyes still red and wet. So the three Antarcans gathered close together, each holding a Beacon in two hands in front of them. “Ok, now push hard with both thumbs? See? easy!.” said Wedge. “Now when Minus says Go, you press and keep pressing, and then when she says stop, you let go.” continued Wedge, then nodding at Minus. “3, 2, 1, Go!” counted Minus and all three activated the Beacons.

The pulse from the three Beacons swept out far and wide so that any Antarcan who was watching could see the blip. “Time” said Minus, and let her thumbs rest. “OK Sami, now just watch, and tell me if you see any blips?” said Wedge. The three of them sat for a few minutes watching their Beacons. No blips this time, but they would try again at the next allotted time. “Must be all still running” said Wedge and continued “We’re bound to get some blips, a lot of bikes made it”. Minus agreed “Yeah, they will want to be really sure they don’t have a tail”. Minus then scanned the horizon behind them “I say we stay put then, try to get at least a blip or two?”. Wedge nodded, and they made camp right there on the Cosmic Expanse.

## Chapter 2: Stretch

Stretch heard many things in his little hide away behind a wall. The Human raid was quick and methodical. He heard them marching around, back and forth. Flash bangs, a few scattered shots, as they moved from room to room. Eventually the troops made it down to the lower level where Stretch was hiding.

They marched right past his wall on the way towards the Armory. He knew that’s where they would face an ambush. Sure enough after a long silence, a barrage of shots and grenades exploding. He was close enough to hear everything, even when Vee called out “Displace! In the tunnel, now, now, now!”.

Stretch heard a lot of screaming and a few Humans running back in retreat. More Humans could be heard assembling above. It was now or never. Stretch ran towards the Armory jumping over the dead and wounded Humans. The Antarcans had caught the Humans completely off guard, and then escaped out the tunnel.

Stretch followed after them crawling along as fast as he could. The tunnel opened up to a sink hole in the ice with a staggered ledge leading up to the surface. As he emerged from the tunnel, he could see Vee ahead of him, and the others further up the ledge.

Stretch pulled back for a moment. He wasn’t sure he wanted to be seen. He felt ashamed, and he wasn’t a soldier like Vee and her crew. But then he remembered his Antarcan Oaths, and continued forward.

“Vee!” he called waving. Vee turned and looked at Stretch in amazement. “Where the hell? Get over here!” yelled Vee. Stretch was still ashamed, but relieved to be back with his people.

He decided that if they get out of this, he would give his Beacon to Vee. Hopefully that would be enough to be forgiven. “I’ll make things right” he muttered to himself as he followed Vee.

## Chapter 3: The Swap

Zero had been patiently scaling the walls below the Radio Tower for hours. He made a deal with himself “I will not look down…” he continued mumbling over and over. Patiently he went from hold to hold, using any broken parts of the wall, and resting when he could. When he reached the top and sat down to catch his breath, he felt exhilarated. Out of all the things he’d been through, that was by far the worst. He resolved himself now “I’m getting in… after that shit? Oh I’m getting in…”. Zero scurried his way around the edge of the wall, looking for a way to get in deeper.

There was a booth nearby, and he could see the back of a Human head. The Human was sitting near a phone and looking down, and occasionally up, then back down again. Zero studied the Human’s movements as he moved closer to the booth. “Sorry pal…” he thought as he slowly moved along the side of the booth towards the closed door. Zero knocked hard and slow three times, and waited. He was holding an iron pipe he had found on his way. Sure enough the Human opened the door, and when he did Zero clubbed him on the head, and dragged him back in the booth.

Zero took the guard’s hat, gun, and security dongle. He found a dark green rain cloak hanging, and put that on. He also saw a remote tracker display, so he grabbed that too. Then he looked down at the unconscious Human. “Can’t have him warn the others…” thought Zero, and then remembered a large sewer pipe he had just passed near the booth. So he carefully dragged the guard over to the sewer pipe.

Getting him up into the pipe was difficult, and he was starting to regain consciousness. Zero put all his effort in, even as the Human was fighting back. “God damn bug, I’ll kill you! You hear me?” yelled the Human, his voice quieter by the second. Zero straightened up, adjusted his hat, and walked briskly into the core of the Human base.

## Chapter 4: On the Road Again

Antarcans have a natural fascination with vehicles of all types, but especially bikes. Out on the Cosmic Expanse, it’s not like you’re going to walk to the corner store.

So when Zero saw the massive Long Haul Transport sitting in the unloading dock his eyes lit up. “There’s my ride!” thought Zero. He paused for a moment by a wall, and pretended to look at his tracker. The truck had its back section up high in the air dumping trash. Smaller bulldozers moved the trash off to the side into a wide river that spilled down into the Main Pipe and washed out over the Cosmic Expanse below.

Zero was fascinated by the Humans. “So this is where all this shit comes from… wow” he mumbled to himself. Soon the Transport started slowly lowering it’s back section. Zero started moving towards it. He walked right over to it, but was careful to keep some distance from the workers. He got a look in the cab and saw it was empty. He waited close by, again looking down at his hands. Then all the workers suddenly ran away as a big water hose came down and blasted the whole area with hot water. While the water was draining, the back of the truck finished lowering.

Zero took this opportunity to walk quickly to the passenger door of the truck. Try as he might, he can’t get it open. “It’s the water!” said a voice behind him. Zero spun on his heels putting his back to the Transport, wondering if his ears had been spotted. It was a human several meters away, running over.

“Watch” said the Human. He rubbed his sleeve on a part of the door. “Quick, scan it now, while it’s dry!” encouraged the Human. Zero stiffly raised the security dongle, and a green light appeared as the door clicked open.

“Have a good one, and don’t stop for nothing in the slums, no matter what you hit, OK pal?” laughed the Human as he waved and strolled away. Zero smiled, nodded politely and waved. Once the Human was looking away, Zero hopped into the Transport, and shifted over to the wheel.

## Chapter 5: Gate Crasher

Zero hovered the security dongle over everything he could think of, nothing worked. He could feel the pedals just fine, and make out some of the other controls, but where’s the starter? Just then a Human comes right out of the door and looks Zero right in the eye. The Human starts yelling “Hey, this is my ride, what gives?”. Zero starts pushing every button, lever, switch.

The Truck starts lighting up and honking then finally lurches forward as bit. “Got it!” thought Zero. Just then the Human yanked the door open, and Zero winked at him. Realizing he was confronting an Antarcan Nomad, he ran screaming in panic and fell into the garbage river. “Pushed my luck enough I think?” mumbled Zero as he closed the door and floored the accelerator.

The Transport engines were slow to get up to speed. Already alarms were sounding, and the gate in front of him closing. Shots started to ping off the Transport as Zero got up to top speed. The gates flew apart like wet paper as the Transport rocketed forward into the tunnel ahead. Leaving the tunnel for a moment, Zero got a quick dazzling flash of green. Not just green, but a million kinds of green he had never imagined. Ahead he saw more buildings, and soon he was back in a tunnel, but this time of concrete buildings on each side.

He’s sure the Humans will be chasing him, so he thinks of how he might stop. Then he notices a pattern… building building… gap… over and over. So he takes his foot off the gas, opens the door, and rolls out on time with a gap.

Zero slams hard into a concrete wall, and flops to the ground. The Transport continues speeding forward, and eventually crashes into a building. Zero can hear screaming all around, and sees some nearby Humans running over. He can barely move, but he forces himself up, and points his gun. The Humans immediately raise their hands, and back away.

Zero holds the gun, backing away. He fires a few shots in front of the crowd, and they scatter. He turns and runs down the wide alley, weaving different directions when he can. He feels dizzy and all the strange noises are not helping.

He could hear sirens in one direction, but then also another, and had no idea where Humans might come from. So he found a spot in a dumpster, and covered himself with the neat and tidy bags of trash. “Trash is better here, huh…” mused Zero, as he settled gently between the pillow like bags.

Then using Antarcan techniques, slowed his breathing down and went into stasis. He would stay like this for many hours, waiting for any pursuing Humans to lose track of him.

## Chapter 6: Human Walk

Zero woke to the sounds of some kind of alarm, and then realized it was just a bird. This place would take some getting used to, “better take it slow, blend in…” he mumbled. He took a quick toke of Kush, then started peering out of the dumpster. It was still light out, but a strange hazy light. The sunset glowed with a strange aura here. He decided to wait until dark, and then try to find some clean clothes.

As night falls, Zero peers out and sees a light in a window above. He can see a woman pass by the window from time to time. She is barely clothed, and seems to be singing while doing chores. The window is propped open half way. Zero scurries up the fire escape, and waits just outside her window. He is completely silent, and prays nobody looks over from another window. As the woman comes and goes, Zero waits, and just peers in when he can. He sees a flash of color as the woman slides open a closet, and pulls a dress from a hanger. She puts it on and then leaves, singing all the while.

Zero doesn’t miss a beat. He slides in the window, grabs the first dress he sees, and notices a hat. It’s a wide brimmed hat with a bit of a veil, great to hide his ears. So with the hat and dress in hand, slides back out the window, the woman none the wiser. Zero creeps slowly down the fire escape, stripping off bits of his current outfit as he goes. By the time he’s at the bottom, he’s ready to try on his new disguise. It’s a yellow dress with little red flowers on it, and it hangs loosely around Zero’s thin frame. He puts on the wide brimmed hat, and adjusts the veil to cover his ears.

“OK, now we’re talking…” Zero said to himself, quite pleased with his progress. Now he just had to blend in… He decided to start by affecting a “Human Walk”, something that says “I’m very busy and important”. He tripped and nearly fell over. “Think Human” he said to himself as he breathed in slowly, “THINK busy and important”. He imagined he was one of the busy dock workers. He lifted his chin and began walking with a quick no nonsense stroll. “Good enough for now” he said to himself as he walked through the city streets into the night.

## Chapter 7: Paradise

Zero walks all night, and into the next day. Just weaving his way randomly. He notices the different areas, the parks, the shops, the apartments. He finds himself gravitating to the parks, and their paths. Then he sees something strange out in the distance. “Ocean” he whispers as he turns towards it as if pulled by a magnet. Zero can’t help but cry tears of joy as he is walking along the boardwalk. His Antarcan boots clomping with each step. He then imagined taking off his boots, and putting his feet in that water.

So as casually as he could, Zero made his way onto the busy beach, and looked for a small corner he could claim. He saw a lady wearing a red dress with little yellow flowers, and a wide brimmed hat. He set up a little away from her, to better blend in. The ocean water on his feet was better than he could ever have imagined.

He closed his eyes, but then immediately opened them. “No, I don’t want to miss one moment.” he said as he looked out at the ocean, smoking his Kush. He then thought about his friends back home. “I will never forget you” he promised, knowing that they are now worlds apart.

Zero sat there for hours looking out at the waves and the people on the beach. After a while he instinctively started filling his pipe, but then put it back down, mumbling “Maybe I’ll take a break, just for a bit.”
